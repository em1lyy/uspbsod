# ntdll

ntdll.h - compatible with MSVC 6.0, Intel C++ Compiler and MinGW. Serves as a complete replacement for Windows.h

This folder includes stuff needed because I work on GNU/Linux and thus don't have all that ntdll stuff but still need to link against it.
I also modified some definitions to build properly
